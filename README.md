CrowdTube-Connector
===================

A utility that syncs subtitles (a.k.a. captions) between YouTube and CrowdIn.

TODO:
- Unit tests
- Logging functionality with verbosity switches
- Figure out sort-ordering in CrowdIn. When uploaded they are correct, but after a few translations are completed they become sorted by translation status with untranslated above translated.  Since these are time-stamped, keeping the order is a big deal.
